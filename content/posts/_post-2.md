description: This blog explores the reasons why IPv5 was never adopted as the successor to IPv4. It discusses the history of IP protocols, the development of IPv5 as an experimental protocol, and the reasons why IPv6 was chosen as the standard protocol for internet communications. The blog concludes that IPv5 was never intended to be widely used, and that starting from scratch with a new design allowed IPv6 to address the limitations of IPv4 more effectively and become the preferred protocol for internet communications.

When you browse the internet, you probably use the Internet Protocol (IP) to connect to websites and other online services. The most commonly used version of IP is IPv4, which has been in use since the early days of the internet. But have you ever wondered why there is no IPv5 protocol, and why it was never adopted as the successor to IPv4?

IPv5 was proposed as an experimental version of the internet protocol in the 1990s, but it never became widely adopted. The reason for this is that IPv6 was developed as a successor to IPv4, and it addressed many of the limitations and security concerns that IPv4 had.

But why was IPv5 never adopted? The answer lies in the history of the internet and the development of IP protocols.

To understand why IPv5 was never adopted, we need to take a step back and look at the development of IP protocols. The first version of IP was IPv1, which was never publicly released. IPv2 was used by a few research networks in the 1970s, but it was quickly replaced by IPv3, which was used in the early ARPANET network. IPv4 was released in 1981 and quickly became the dominant protocol for internet communications.

In the 1990s, an experimental protocol called Internet Stream Protocol (ST) was developed, which was later renamed IPv5. IPv5 was designed to support real-time multimedia applications, such as video conferencing and audio streaming. It was intended to work alongside IPv4 as a complement rather than a replacement.

However, IPv5 was never fully developed or implemented. Instead, the designers of IPv6 decided to start from scratch with a completely new design rather than building on top of IPv4 or IPv5. IPv6 was designed to address the limitations of IPv4, including a limited address space and security concerns.

IPv6 provides a much larger address space than IPv4, which allows for more devices to be connected to the internet. It also includes built-in security features to help protect against cyber attacks. IPv6 was adopted as the successor to IPv4, and it has become the standard protocol for internet communications.

So why didn't IPv5 become the successor to IPv4? The answer is that it was an experimental protocol that was never intended to be widely used. The designers of IPv6 chose to start from scratch with a new design, rather than building on top of IPv4 or IPv5. This allowed them to address the limitations of IPv4 more effectively and create a more robust and secure protocol for internet communications.

In conclusion, the mystery of IPv5 is not so mysterious after all. It was an experimental protocol that was never fully developed or widely adopted. The internet community moved on to IPv6 as the successor to IPv4, and it has become the standard protocol for internet communications. The lesson to be learned from this is that sometimes, starting from scratch and developing something new can be the best approach, rather than building on top of what already exists.
